# Written Responses
## 1. One or two key differences that stood out to you between relational databases (e.g., MySQL) and non-relational/document databases (e.g., MongoDB)?
- One key difference between relational databases like MySQL and document databases like MongoDB is schema flexibility. Relational databases typically use rigid schemas with tables, rows, and columns, while MongoDB allows documents within the same collection to have different fields and structures, making it easier to adapt to evolving data requirements.
- Another key difference is query language. Relational databases use SQL for querying data, while MongoDB uses its own query language based on JavaScript-like syntax.

## 2. One healthcare-specific scenario where using a non-SQL database like MongoDB would be appropriate, and why.
- A healthcare-specific scenario where a non-SQL database like MongoDB would be appropriate is, patient data management. MongoDB can store and query patient records, such as medical history, treatment plans, and lab results. It's ability to handle JSON-like documents, makes it easy to model complex healthcare data.
